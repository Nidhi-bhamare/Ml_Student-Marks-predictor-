# Ml_Student_Marks_predictor-:

Creating a Student Marks Predictor using a machine learning algorithm involves several steps, including data collection, data cleaning, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Below is a structured approach to build a student marks predictor using Python and popular libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and Flask for deployment.

Step 1: Data Collection
First, you need a dataset. For this example, let's assume you have a CSV file (student_scores.csv) with the following columns:

hours_studied: Number of hours a student studied.
marks_obtained: Marks obtained by the student.
Step 2: Data Cleaning
Ensure your data is clean and free from missing or inconsistent values.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data to make it suitable for training the model.

Step 4: Model Training
Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data. We'll use a simple linear regression model for this example.

Step 5: Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance to ensure it generalizes well to new data.

Step 6: Deployment
Deploy the model using Flask to create a simple web interface for predictions.
